#Code Challenge

In order to run the application please make sure you have **Node.js** and **NPM** installed, also it would be helpful to have the GitBash integrated terminal installed.
The Application has been written with Vanila JavaScript using standards from ES2015, ES2016 & ES2017. It uses webpack, Babel and webpack-dev-server to compile and serve. It is fully compatible with Async/Await as it uses the Babel polyfill.
I understand that frameworks are necessary and make work easy and fast. However, at the end of the day, the are just frameworks.

To run the webpack server please execute command> **npm run start**

**API** provided probably can be reached internally, I could not make request becouse of server 404 response.

**Please make sure** that:
    const response = await fetch(`https://jobs.search.gov/jobs/search.json?query=${query}`);
    *please make sure to run app while server returning response I understand I had no rights to send-receive query*

    *please make sure to return correct response as per example send redData should return an Array with JSON*

Best Regards,
Kamil
